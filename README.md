# Books 

##  Introduction
This is the list of books that cover the core, timeless, ideas that change the way you see the world and improve your thinking. The list is highly inspired by the [Great Mental Model Project](https://fs.blog/tgmm/) and by the [Navals Ravikant's](https://www.navalmanack.com/navals-recommended-reading) reading list. It is important to read good books in the right order. The 'right' order is the bottom-up order, meaning starting from the most fundamental and moving to more advanced topics.
