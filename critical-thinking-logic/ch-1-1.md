## Barriers to Critical Thinking
Critical thinking is a time-consuming way to solve problems. We prefer to spend less time, and we solve problems using <b>intuition and beliefs</b>. In addition, sometimes we are making decisions <b>emotionally</b> or having <b>biases</b> towards one or another solution. The truth is that for most cases, it is just fine. We should employ critical thinking only for important and complicated decisions.

## Mental Exercise to develop Critical Thinking
One of the best exercises to practice Critical Thinking is news review. Social Media and different news websites have exposed us to a lot of information and disinformation. To make sense of the chaos, we can apply Critical Thinking in the following way
### 1. Problem Statement 
Choose the topic and define the goal. Examples:   
  - Who is right in a conflict between A and B. 
  - What is the right investment strategy after the change of regulations.
### 2. Fact, Observations, and Open Questions
Read 2-4 articles on the topic from sources representing different opinions. List facts and observations on the topic. 
Set an accuracy grade for each fact and observation. For example, 100% will be given to any item that is based on data or comes from a highly reliable source. Any shameless lie will get 0%. Add open questions to the list. Research and try to answer them.
### 3. Solution 
Use logical reasoning to solve the problem. If there are missing data, add questions to the list from 2 and repeat the process from the beginning.
