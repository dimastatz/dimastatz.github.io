## Background
Over time, people's interactions with computers have undergone significant evolution. Initially, users engaged with computers through text-based interfaces, inputting commands into a command-line interface. The introduction of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) made interaction more visual and intuitive, enabling users to navigate and manipulate content through icons, windows, and menus. Subsequently, touch screens revolutionized computer interaction by allowing direct manipulation of content with fingers, enhancing navigation efficiency and user engagement. 
In these days, advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and speech recognition are driving a notable shift in user-computer interaction. With improved natural language understanding and hands-free operation, facilitated by LLMs and speech recognition technologies, the development of conversational AI systems and virtual assistants is enhancing communication efficiency and convenience.
