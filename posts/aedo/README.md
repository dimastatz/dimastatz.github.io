## Background
Content-related advertisement technology, known as dynamic ad insertion (DAI), enables advertisers to deliver targeted ads to users in real-time during video or audio consumption. Leveraging data analytics and algorithms, DAI matches ads with the context of the content and user preferences, ensuring relevance and engagement. In video content, DAI seamlessly inserts ads into the stream, while in podcasts and audio streams, it strategically places ads at optimal points to minimize disruption. This approach enhances ad effectiveness by delivering personalized messages to audiences, driving higher engagement and conversion rates. Furthermore, DAI provides advertisers with valuable insights into ad performance and audience behavior, enabling them to refine targeting strategies and optimize ad spend.
