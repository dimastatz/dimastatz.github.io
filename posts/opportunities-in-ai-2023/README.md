# Exploring Opportunities in AI

## Background
AI is a general purpose technology, meaning it is not usefull just for one thing, but it can be applied for a lots of different applications. Probably a good way to think about AI as a collection of tools: Supervised Learning, Generative AI, Unsupervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning. These tools can be used all over the AI stack, from Hardware to User Applications.

AI technologies are evolving continiously and create new bussiness oportunities. Now it is time for the Generative AI to shine. The goal of this document is to explore new opportunities in AI in 2023. The focus will be on a money machine bussiness that can be created by a small group of Software Developers by applying their expertise and a limited using of financial leverage.


## Hardware and Infrastructure  
Entering the Hardware and Infrastructure markets is challenging due to high initial investment, regulatory compliance, long product development cycles and intense competition. All these factors collectively contribute to the difficulty small startups face in entering and competing in this market. Overall, this market is not recommended for building money machines.


## Developer Tools
AI Developer tools are created by teams of AI Scientists and Software Engineers. They understand how computers learn and use their skills to build software that helps others create AI programs easily. Starting a business in this domain requires a high level of expertise and a significant time for research in AI due to the complexity of products. This field revolves around innovating and crafting something new from scratch at just the right time. The success rate here is low, but the potential rewards can be immense.


## Software Frameworks
A team of skilled Software Developers can launch a business in this field without needing specific business or science expertise. Finding a niche here is less complicated compared to other domains. Here are just a couple of approaches. 
1. Develop cost-effective alternatives to services offered by major companies like AWS, Azure, GCP. For example, AWS Transcribe, while powerful, can be expensive. This prompted the creation of budget-friendly frameworks with both free and premium versions.
2. Search GitHub for widely used, labor-intensive functionalities. Develop a library with both free and premium versions to streamline these processes.
3. Translate a library from one programming language to another and create a library with free and premium versions. For examples, Plotly Pro is a paid Python library and can be translated to Java.

## Software Services
Software Services domain just like Software Frameworks can be profitable for software developers. However, creating Services is more challenging due to the need to manage infrastructure, deployment, and security. On the other hand, Services have a broader audience as businesses can directly use them, while Frameworks are primarily for other developers. The strategy for finding a niche in Software Services are somewhat different. Here creators should have some knowledge in bussiness that they are going to serve.
