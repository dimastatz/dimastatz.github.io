# Bussiness Opportunities for Developers in AI


## Background
As technologies advance, they create new business opportunities. Today, there a lot of hype around AI. AI has the potential to revolutionize industries, improve efficiency, and create innovative solutions to complex problems.  A good way to think about AI as a collection of tools: Supervised Learning, Generative AI, Unsupervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning. These tools can be used all over the AI stack, from Hardware to User Applications.

This document aims to offer a Business Building Framework tailored for small teams of software developers. With this approach, developers can leverage their expertise for a new business venture with minimal financial investment.


## Rule 1: Prefer Automation over Disruption
Automation and disruption are two distinct concepts, associated with technological advancements. Automation focuses on optimizing and streamlining existing processes, while disruption aims to create entirely new paradigms, often through the introduction of groundbreaking technologies or business models. Disruptive businesses demand significant initial investment and considerable time for profitable scaling. That's why small, financially limited developer teams, should place a strong emphasis on Automation.


## Rule 2: Avoid Hardware and Infrastructure Markets
Entering the Hardware and Infrastructure markets is challenging due to high initial investment, regulatory compliance, long product development cycles and intense competition. All these factors collectively contribute to the difficulty small startups face in entering and competing in this market. Overall, this market is not recommended for building small bussiness.


## Rule 3: Double Check On Developer Tools
AI Developer tools are created by teams of AI Scientists and Software Engineers. They understand how computers learn and use their skills to build software that helps others create AI programs easily. Starting a business in this domain requires a high level of expertise and a significant time for research in AI due to the complexity of products. This field revolves around innovating and crafting something new from scratch at just the right time. The success rate here is low, but the potential rewards can be immense.


## Rule 4: Software Frameworks Is A Starting Point
Creating software frameworks presents a valuable opportunity for developers (especially for Juniors), to build impactful tools, refine their skills, and potentially launch a successful business. Identifying a niche in this domain is generally less complex compared to other areas. Here are a couple of approaches to consider.
1. Develop cost-effective alternatives to services offered by major companies like AWS, Azure, GCP. For example, AWS Transcribe, while powerful, can be expensive. This prompted the creation of budget-friendly frameworks with both free and premium versions.
2. Search GitHub for widely used, labor-intensive functionalities. Develop a library with both free and premium versions to streamline these processes. Web Scrappers are great example for a such an approach. There a bunch of frameworks that implement functioanity for scrapping financial data (yahoo-finance), news (newspaper3k), etc. 
3. Translate a library from one programming language to another and create a library with free and premium versions. For examples, Plotly Pro is a paid Python library and can be translated to Java, C++ or Rust.


## Rule 4: Emphasize Software as a Service (SaaS)
Software Services, like Software Frameworks, can be a lucrative venture for developers. However, creating Services is more demanding due to the responsibilities of managing infrastructure, deployment, and security. On the other hand, Services have a wider user base, as both individuals and businesses can directly benefit from them, while Frameworks cater mainly to other developers. Creators of Services should possess a strong grasp of the specific business domain they intend to serve. For example the following framework for finding the righ niche might work:
1. Choose a bissness and analyze the responsibilities of both employees. Break down each bussiness role into individual tasks.
2. Evaluate if each task can benefit from assistance or automation through AI tools like supervised learning or generative AI.
3. Evaluate the worth of these changes. If the new service can save approximately 80% of time in a specific business role, it is certainly worthwhile to develop it.


## Rule 4: Software Applications
While SaaS excels in cloud-based computing, Software Applications provide distinct advantages in accessibility, user experience, device integration, and offline functionality. They complement SaaS solutions, meeting the preferences of users on a specific platform. Developing Software Applications is often more time-consuming and intricate compared to SaaS. It's recommended to consider building an app after establishing a successful SaaS, especially if you aim to expand functionality or reach a broader audience across Android, iPhone, MacOS or Windows users.
