# Exploring Opportunities in AI

## Background
AI is a general purpose technology, meaning it is not usefull just for one thing, but it can be applied for a lots of different applications. Probably a good way to think about AI as a collection of tools: Supervised Learning, Generative AI, Unsupervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning. These tools can be used all over the AI stack, from Hardware to User Applications.

AI technologies are evolving continiously and create new bussiness oportunities. Now it is time for the Generative AI to shine. The goal of this document is to explore new opportunities in AI in 2023. The focus will be on a money machine bussiness that can be created by a small group of Software Developers by applying their expertise and a limited using of financial leverage.


## Hardware and Infrastructure 
Entering the Hardware and Infrastructure markets is challenging due to high initial investment, complex supply chains, regulatory compliance, long product development cycles, intense competition, and the need for specialized expertise. Established players, cost sensitivity, and long sales cycles also pose significant barriers to entry.  


## AI Developer Tools
AI Developer tools are created by teams of AI Scientists and Software Engineers. They understand how computers learn and use their skills to build software that helps others create AI programs easily. Starting a business in this domain requires a high level of expertise and a significant time for research in AI due to the complexity of products. This field revolves around innovating and crafting something new from scratch at just the right time. The success rate here is low, but the potential rewards can be immense.


## Software Frameworks
A team of skilled Software Developers can launch a business in this field without needing specific business or science expertise. Finding a niche here is less complicated compared to other industries. One approach is to explore GitHub repositories for functionalities that are widely used but require significant effort. Another approach is to create a simplified alternative to costly services provided by big companies like AWS, Azure, or GCP. For instance, AWS Transcribe, a speech-to-text service, is powerful but expensive. This led to the creation of the more budget-friendly WhisperPlus framework, which, while not as comprehensive, suffices for many app developers.
