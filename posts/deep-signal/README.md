## Background
With the widespread use of cameras and microphones, along with the growing trend of remote communication through video and audio calls, the amount of video and audio data is rapidly increasing. This has led to a significant role for video and audio analysis across various industries, including:
- Media and Entertainment: Analyzing content, tracking audience engagement.
- Healthcare: Assisting diagnoses, monitoring patients, analyzing medical images.
- Manufacturing: Controlling quality, optimizing processes, detecting defects.
- Transportation: Monitoring traffic, detecting accidents, managing congestion.
- Retail: Analyzing customer behavior, managing inventory, assessing marketing effectiveness.
- Finance: Detecting fraud, monitoring transactions, ensuring compliance.
- Education: Personalizing learning experiences, recommending content, assessing student performance.
- Security and Law Enforcement: Monitoring surveillance footage, detecting threats, gathering evidence.
- Telecom: Analyzing call center data, understanding customer sentiment, transcribing voice calls.
- Gaming: Analyzing player behavior, integrating advertisements, incorporating virtual assistants.

This increase in data volume, fueled by the rise of remote communication methods, highlights the wide-ranging importance of video and audio analysis technologies.

## Problem Statement
As demand increases, numerous multimedia processing frameworks have emerged. Among the most renowned are FFmpeg, OpenCV, and GStreamer, each providing extensive toolsets for manipulating and analyzing multimedia content. However, these frameworks cannot serve as centralized hubs for real-time analysis of video and data, necessitating the development of frameworks that can be easily consumed by application developers and create production-ready, scalable services. Ideally, such frameworks should be easy to use from different programming languages and scalable through a well-known data processing platform. TensorFlow and PyTorch, recognized for their machine learning capabilities, also offer features for processing audio and video data, particularly for tasks such as recognition and classification. Furthermore, VLC media player and MEncoder supply libraries and APIs for integrating multimedia functionalities into applications, with VLC boasting support for a broad spectrum of formats and MEncoder specializing in encoding files into diverse formats. However, the challenge remains in finding frameworks that fulfill the need for centralized, real-time analysis while being easily consumable by developers and capable of creating scalable, production-ready services.
