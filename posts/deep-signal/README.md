# Unveiling Deep Signal: Part 1 - Defining the Problem

## Background
With the widespread use of cameras and microphones, along with the growing trend of remote communication through video and audio calls, the amount of video and audio data is rapidly increasing. This has led to a significant role for video and audio analysis across various industries, including:
- Media and Entertainment: Analyzing content, tracking audience engagement.
- Healthcare: Assisting diagnoses, monitoring patients, analyzing medical images.
- Manufacturing: Controlling quality, optimizing processes, detecting defects.
- Transportation: Monitoring traffic, detecting accidents, managing congestion.
- Retail: Analyzing customer behavior, managing inventory, assessing marketing effectiveness.
- Finance: Detecting fraud, monitoring transactions, ensuring compliance.
- Education: Personalizing learning experiences, recommending content, assessing student performance.
- Security and Law Enforcement: Monitoring surveillance footage, detecting threats, gathering evidence.
- Telecom: Analyzing call center data, understanding customer sentiment, transcribing voice calls.
- Gaming: Analyzing player behavior, integrating advertisements, incorporating virtual assistants.

This increase in data volume, fueled by the rise of remote communication methods, highlights the wide-ranging importance of video and audio analysis technologies.

## Problem Statement
The increasing demand for multimedia processing has led to the emergence of numerous frameworks such as [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), and [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/), [OpenAI Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper) offering extensive toolsets for manipulating and analyzing multimedia content. However, these frameworks lack the capability to function as centralized hubs for real-time video and data analysis, highlighting the need for the development of frameworks that are easily accessible to application developers and can generate scalable, production-ready services. Ideally, such frameworks should offer ease of integration across different programming languages and scalability through integration with established data processing platforms. Despite the capabilities of TensorFlow, PyTorch, VLC media player, and MEncoder in processing audio and video data, there persists a challenge in finding frameworks that can efficiently meet the requirements for centralized, real-time analysis while ensuring ease of adoption and scalability for developers.


## Objectives
The objectives presented here result from  examining the problem statement from previous section. They focus on improving multimedia processing frameworks in key areas. These objectives aim to create a central hub for real-time video and data analysis, make the framework easy for developers to use for scalable services, ensure smooth integration across different programming languages, implement scalability features using established data processing platforms, and enhance existing frameworks for centralized, real-time analysis. These goals aim to tackle challenges and drive innovation in multimedia processing technologies.
- Develop a multimedia processing framework capable of serving as a centralized hub for real-time analysis of video and data.
- Ensure that the framework is easily consumable by application developers, facilitating the creation of production-ready and scalable services.
- Enable seamless integration across different programming languages to enhance accessibility and adoption among developers.
- Implement scalability features within the framework, allowing it to leverage well-known data processing platforms for efficient scaling as per demand.
- Enhance the capabilities of existing frameworks to meet the requirements for centralized, real-time analysis while maintaining ease of use and scalability.


## Apache Spark
[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) emerges as a versatile and powerful platform for data processing and analysis. Originally designed for large-scale data processing of structured and unstructured data, Apache Spark can be extended to handle multimedia data with relative ease. Its distributed computing architecture and support for various programming languages make it an attractive choice for processing massive volumes of video and audio data efficiently.


## Deep Signal
Recognizing the need for a unified solution for multimedia analysis, Deep Signal steps in to fill the void. Built on top of Apache Spark, Deep Signal harnesses the capabilities of this robust framework to provide comprehensive video and audio analysis at scale. By leveraging Apache Spark's distributed computing capabilities, Deep Signal empowers organizations to extract actionable insights from their multimedia data swiftly and effectively. From sentiment analysis in customer service calls to content classification in video streams, Deep Signal offers a versatile toolkit for unlocking the potential of multimedia data.
