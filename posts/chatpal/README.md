# ChatPal: English Language Learning in Virtual Reality

## Project Overview
ChatPal is an immersive English language learning game designed for the Oculus VR platform. Inspired by the Tamagotchi concept, ChatPal allows kids to interact with a virtual parrot while engaging in language learning activities. Through conversations and interactive exercises, players will improve their English skills in a fun and engaging virtual environment.

## Key Features

- Virtual Parrot Companion:
Players will have a virtual parrot companion that they can interact with in the VR environment.
The parrot will respond to players' actions and engage in conversations to facilitate language learning.

- Conversation Practice:
The game will provide various conversation scenarios where players can practice speaking English with the parrot.
Conversations will cover a range of topics including greetings, everyday activities, and common phrases.

- Language Learning Activities:
Interactive language learning activities such as vocabulary quizzes, pronunciation exercises, and grammar drills will be included.
Progress tracking will monitor players' proficiency levels and provide feedback to aid improvement.

- Virtual Environment:
The VR environment will feature immersive landscapes and interactive elements to enhance the learning experience.
Players can explore different locations and interact with objects to further engage with the language.

- Customization and Personalization:
Players will have the option to customize their parrot companion's appearance, name, and personality.
Personalized learning paths will adapt to individual player preferences and learning styles.
