# [ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/chatgpt-prompt-eng/)

## Background
ChatGPT is an innovative AI tool that boosts productivity in learning, writing, and coding. However, using ChatGPT can be challenging, requiring specific instructions to achieve accurate results. For instance, asking ChatGPT about 'John Smith' without specifying the context can lead to ambiguity, considering various individuals with the same name. This course empowers developers with effective techniques to prompt, summarize, transform, and expand texts using the ChatGPT API, enabling the creation of novel applications through the integration of programming skills and ChatGPT.
