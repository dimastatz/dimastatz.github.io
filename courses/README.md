# Computer Science Curriculum

## Introductions
Computer Science is the study of algorithms, data structures, and computational systems. It covers everything from writing code to designing complex software. It's entirely possible to acquire a solid understanding of computer science as a self-learner. There are abundant online resources, courses, books and communities available. Consistent practice, hands-on projects, and a curious mindset are key to success.
