# Semantic Kernel

## Background
LLMs are incredibly powerful and user-friendly when used with a single prompt. However, building applications for more complex use cases, such as Virtual Assistants, Coding Copilots, and Domain-Specific knowledge summarizers, presents challenges. One interesting aspect is generating next steps in prompts chains without human input, and another is creating context-based chats between humans and applications using existing domain knowledge.

## Semantic Kernel
To address these challenges in complex Generative AI applications, the [Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/overview/) framework offers valuable patterns and plugins that can be relied upon for assistance.
