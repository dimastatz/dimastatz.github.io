# Atoms in motions

## Matter is made of atoms
All things are made of atomsâ€”little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. 

The difference between solids and liquids is, then, that in a solid the atoms are arranged in some kind of an array, called a crystalline array, and they do not have a random position at long distances; the position of the atoms on one side of the crystal is determined by that of other atoms millions of atoms away on the other side of the crystal.

## Atomic processes
Q: What is the difference between atoms and molecules
A: Molecules are made from atoms. Atom is a basic unit of matter. Atom is composed of electrons, protons, and neutrons. Neutron is neutral in charge. Protons have a positive charge and electrons have a negative charge.

Q: Why do atoms form molecules
A: When proton or electron is lost, an atom can become positively or negatively charged. In order to get to balance atoms attract one another and become balanced together.

Q: What is the difference between solid, liquid and gas states of the same matter.
A: There is no difference between molecules. In different states molecules have different arrangement.
