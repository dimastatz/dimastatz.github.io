## Brief

### 1. Why do we need this book
People have a superficial knowledge about the world. It makes a lot of sense, because the world is complex. One cannot be an expert in everything. Knowing the basics can help to reduce the comprehension deficit. The idea of this book is to break down the economy to the most fundamental components and to explain each one in details.  

### 2. Energy
What is the best metric to track in order to understand how our world really works? The author suggest to track energy consumption and the number of different forms of energy available. For example, energy consumption per capita in developed countries is 4-5 times higher than the energy consumption in poor countries. Another interesting question is what are sources of energy that we use? How fast can we move to green energy only? It comes out that the electricity is only around 20% of energy that we are using. 

### 3. Food Production
Fossil fuels are the main source of energy for Food Production. It starts from producing fertilizers and ends by diesel that is used in cars distributing food to local stores. A couple of interesting facts: it takes 0.3L of diesel to produce 1Kg of wheat flour. It takes the same amount of diesel to produce 1kg of chicken. Producing 1kg of tomatoes is twice as expensive.

### 4. The Four Pillars of Modern Civilization
[Ammonia](), [Steel](), [Plastic]() and [Cement]() are four pillars of modern civilization.

### 5. Globalization
