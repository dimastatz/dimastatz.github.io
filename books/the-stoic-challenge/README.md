## Brief
The author of this book uses Stoic Philosophy and Modern Psychology methods to handle life's challenges. Usually, people respond to setbacks with anger, fear or anxiety. Author proposes to take each life situation as a challenge when the goal is not only to resolve the problem but also to stay calm. Here is how the author is proposing to do it:

1. Recognize that people have two minds: conscious and subconscious. Conscious mind is mainly rational. Subconscious mind is person's unprocessed experience. 

2. Subconscious mind is responsible for responding to setback with anger. It happens because the rational part of mind doesn't know how to deal with reality and unconscious mind starts to operate.

3. Author proposes that there are two ways to deal with it: anchoring and framing.
    
    a. Anchoring is a type of meditation when you think about being in a very bad situation. For example, thing about being unhealthy in a bed. When a person anchors his mind in this way, all other problem seem not so bad. BTW it is looks like the gratitude meditation.
    
    b. Framing is about looking for opportunity in every single bad situation. For example, a person lost some money batting on stock. This person can think, that it is actually a good lesson on investment.

    c. (Not mentioned by the author) Another good technique is to meditate. Meditation clears unconscious mind. Think about your mind as a storage of all past events. Sometimes an event can pop up and make you angry. And this is because you didn't think through it. Meditation is all about that. Seat(walk) in a quiet place, let you mind running and popping up all events. When all problems are resolved, your subconscious mind is clean, and it won't respond with anger.
