Visum is packaged as a JAR and deployed to Maven. Here are some common approaches:
- A dual licensing approach where you offer your software component under both an open-source license and a commercial license. This allows customers to choose between using the JAR file under an open-source license (with certain restrictions) or purchasing a commercial license for more permissive usage and additional benefits.
- Enterprise Licensing: target larger organizations and enterprises with enterprise licensing options. This could involve negotiating customized licensing agreements based on factors such as the number of users, deployment scale, specific requirements, and dedicated support.
- Providing additional APIs or add-on modules that complement your JAR file and enhance its functionality. You can offer these as separate products or extensions, allowing customers to extend the capabilities of your software component by purchasing and integrating these additional components.
