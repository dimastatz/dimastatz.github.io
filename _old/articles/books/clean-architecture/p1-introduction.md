# Introduction
Software Architecture is a discipline of creating fundamental software structures and a high-level decision. Software Architecture is analogous to an Architecture of building. It is about the shape of building, rooms layout, outward appearance, etc.   
The goal of Software Architecture is to minimize the amount of resources needed to build and maintain the required system

## A Tale of two values
Software Systems provide users two values: behavior and structure. Behavior is what software can do and structure is how simple to perform changes of the behavior. Naturally, developers tend to focus on the system's behavior, because it what customers see. The problem is that when developers stop to invest in system's structure, the cost of developing new features skyrockets.
